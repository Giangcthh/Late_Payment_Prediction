# ML-Project
A machine learning model to predict loan default using a comprehensive fintech dataset from Kaggle. Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling missing values and performing both univariate and multivariate analyses. Applied the IQR method to detect outliers in numerical features. Engineered meaningful features from customer and loan data. Employed and compared multiple feature selection techniques to identify the most predictive variables. Built and evaluated various classification models, including ensemble methods, with data preprocessing pipelines. Assessed model performance using key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, balanced accuracy, and PR-AUC.
